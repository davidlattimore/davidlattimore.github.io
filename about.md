I'm a software developer in Sydney, Australia. I'm currently taking a break from paid employment to
work on various open-source Rust projects.

My main projects are:

* [Wild](https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild) - a work-in-progress linker written in Rust with
  the goal of being incremental and very fast. This is what I'm spending most of my time on at the
  moment.
* [Evcxr](https://github.com/evcxr/evcxr) - a REPL and Jupyter kernel for Rust.
* [Cackle](https://github.com/davidlattimore/cackle) - A code ACL checker for Rust.

For other less-used Rust crates that I've published, see
[crates.io](https://crates.io/users/davidlattimore).

I love to talk to people face-to-face where possible. If you live in or are visiting Sydney, let me
know and we can meet up for coffee. Otherwise, I find video chat almost as good. You can book a spot
in [my calendar](https://calendar.app.google/MBYQeATMNBvuK8AZ6) to chat. If you can't find a time
that works, email me and I'll see what I can do.

For asynchronous communication, [email](mailto:dvdlttmr@gmail.com) is probably the best way to
contact me.

If you like the work I'm doing, you can [sponsor me via GitHub
sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/davidlattimore).
