Some Rust projects that I work on:

* [Evcxr](https://github.com/evcxr/evcxr) - a REPL and Jupyter kernel for Rust.
* [Cackle](https://github.com/davidlattimore/cackle) - A code ACL checker for Rust.

For other less-used Rust crates that I've published, see
[crates.io](https://crates.io/users/davidlattimore).

Email is probably the best way to contact me. You can find my email address by looking for my recent
commits in any of the above repositories.
