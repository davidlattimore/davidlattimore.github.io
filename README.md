Some Rust projects that I work on:

* [Wild](https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild) - a work-in-progress incremental linker written in
  Rust. This is what I'm spending most of my time on at the moment.
* [Evcxr](https://github.com/evcxr/evcxr) - a REPL and Jupyter kernel for Rust.
* [Cackle](https://github.com/davidlattimore/cackle) - A code ACL checker for Rust.

For other less-used Rust crates that I've published, see
[crates.io](https://crates.io/users/davidlattimore).

I love to talk to people face-to-face where possible. If you live in or are visiting Sydney, let me
know and we can meet up for coffee. Otherwise, I find video chat almost as good. You can book a spot
in [my calendar](https://calendar.app.google/MBYQeATMNBvuK8AZ6) to chat. If you can't find a time
that works, email me and I'll see if what I can do.

For asynchronous communication, email is probably the best way to contact me. You can find my email
address by looking for my recent commits in any of the above repositories.
