Last week, I had the pleasure of having a conversation with Tim McNamara for [an
episode](https://timclicks.dev/podcast/david-lattimore-faster-linker-faster-builds) of his podcast,
Compose. We talked about the Wild linker, linking in general, Rust coding styles, contributing to
open source and a range of other topics.
